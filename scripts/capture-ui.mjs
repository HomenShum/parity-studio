/**
 * capture-ui.mjs — drive the real apps in headless Chromium and write frames.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The browser-automation surface in the agent harness could screenshot but not
 * record: starting a GIF recording wedged the renderer every time, and the
 * screenshot tool's save-to-disk wrote nowhere findable. So visual evidence
 * existed only inside a chat transcript, which is not evidence anyone else can
 * check.
 *
 * Playwright is already a dependency of all three apps and Chromium is already
 * cached, so this drives the real browser directly and writes real files.
 *
 * Frames are written as PNGs and assembled into a GIF by assemble-gif.mjs.
 * Nothing here is simulated: if a page fails to load, the run FAILS rather than
 * emitting a frame that implies it rendered.
